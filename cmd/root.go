working on reduced code and configurations rather than
directly on the full code.

You can do things like:
  - update one file or configuration and see
    the change propagate to multiple files,
  - rapidly switch the same code between
    different environments,
  - switch testing/debug code on or off,
  - or easily do your own code generation

while you still have full transparency to the source code.
Keeping your code DRY is easier and the code simpler.`,
